Working with competitive programming problems(basic of c++  STL)
WEEK 1 :- Started with - Template , time complexity,operators, c++ stL data structures (stack . queue, vector,dequeue, priority list)
Completed introductory problems from CSES.
WEEK 2:- Then we did sorting(c++ , algorithms) , searching(binary) and number theory (factors , combinatorics).
Completed problems of searching , sorting from CSES and some from codeforces
WEEK 3 :- Then we moved to graphs , its representation , terminology - traversal (depth first , breadth first , applications) , shortest path (single source which includes dijkstra , bellman ford ; all pair which includes floyd warshall) , directed acyclic graphs (topological sort) .
Completed graph algorithm , counting rooms , monsters and some codeforces problems.
WEEK 4 :- Then we did Divide-conquer , its time complexity ; Greedy & disjoint set unions.
completed problems from codeforces.
WEEK 5 :- Then we moved to Dynamic Programming , examples like knapsack , LIS , ,atrix parenthesisation.
we completed problems of DP from CSES.
WEEK 6:- Then we did Range queries - prefix arrays , sparse table , fenwick - segment tree;
We completed Range XOR queries , forest queries , list removals from CSES.
WEEK 7 :- At last we did , flows and tries - flows , its terminology , ford fulkerson, max bipartite matching ; tries (insertion , search).
And completed problems from CSES of download speed , police chase and school dance.
